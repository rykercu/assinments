# Instructions

## Step 1
Make sure you have cloned your Assignment 1 repository to your computer.

## Step 2
Create a new branch called `<your-name>/assignment-4`. For example, if your name is John Smith, you would create a branch called `john-smith/assignment-4`.

## Step 3
Move this folder into your repo.

## Step 4
Rename your folder to assignment-4.

## Step 5
Fill out your html files so they all are identical to the `assignment-4-screenshot.png` file except the header.html file.  It will contain the header code which will be injected into each of the other pages.

## Step 6
Commit and push your changes to your new branch and let me know in Slack that you are done.

*Note:* Do not modify the html-importer.js and reset.css files!
